# Bee Monitoring MLMachine learning model to detect pollinator presence on Salt Marsh Bird’s Beak and Ventura Marsh Milkvetch. Uses synthetic training data generated by overlaying bee stills onto vegetation images, with model training performed using PyTorch.Includes:- `mlm_1.py` – model architecture and training script- `synthetic_image_generator_v5.py` – creates training data by compositing bees onto background imagesDeveloped at UCSB CCBER, Summer 2025.
